% Description: Calculate the perceived pitch of a note based on 
%               Gockel, H., B.J.C. Moore,and R.P. Carlyon. 2001. 
%               Influence of rate of change of frequency on the overall 
%               pitch of frequency-modulated Tones." Journal of the Acoustical Society of America 109, no. 2 (2001): 701?12.
% Inputs:
%  onsoffs - a 3*N alignment matrix, the first row is a list of N states
%            the second row is the time which the state ends, and the
%            third row is the state index
%
% Outputs:
%  res.ons - list of onset times
%  res.offs - list of offset times

% The note is provided as a vector of f0s and the sample rate at which they
% are measured (e.g. the hop rate in Hz of yin).  The gamma parameter sets
% the relative weighting of quickly changing vs slowly changing portions of
% notes.  A high gamma gives more weight to slowly changing portions.

f0s(isnan(f0s))=[];
deriv = [diff(f0s)*sr -100];
weights = exp(-gamma * abs(deriv));
pp = f0s(:)' * weights(:) / sum(weights);
